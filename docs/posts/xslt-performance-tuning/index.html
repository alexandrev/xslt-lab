The stylesheet looks clean, the output is correct, but the transform slows down as the input grows. Most of the time this is caused by expensive selections that are repeated in loops, or by deep <code>//</code> searches that scan the entire tree more often than you expect. The good news is that you can usually fix these issues without turning the stylesheet into unreadable micro-optimizations.</p><p>The first step is to examine where you are traversing the document. XSLT processors are optimized for template matching, so prefer <code>xsl:apply-templates</code> and specific match patterns over <code>xsl:for-each</code> with <code>//</code> in the select. When you do need a search, limit it to the smallest possible subtree. A single <code>//</code> at the top-level becomes a full-tree scan each time it runs. If it runs inside another loop, the cost can explode.</p><p>Keys are the most important performance feature, and they also improve readability. When you define an <code>xsl:key</code>, you turn a repeated search into a fast lookup. This is especially critical for join-like operations where you match a reference value to another document or a secondary section of the same document. Build the key once, and then use <code>key('id', $value)</code> everywhere. The intent becomes clear: you are doing a lookup, not a scan. If you only use keys occasionally, it can feel like overkill, but it is often the biggest win.</p><p>Modes are another useful tool. If you use the same templates in multiple contexts, you may end up doing extra work or firing templates that you do not need. A dedicated mode lets you create a focused processing pipeline that touches only the nodes relevant to that output section. This can reduce both runtime and mental overhead. It also makes it easier to reason about precedence: within a mode, you can define more specific templates without worrying about side effects on unrelated parts of the transform.</p><p>Consider caching computed values in variables. XSLT variables are immutable, so they are safe to reuse without unintended side effects. If you are computing a complex string or a filtered node set repeatedly, store it once per relevant scope. Just be careful not to define a variable at the top of the stylesheet if it depends on the context; keep it as close as possible to where it is used to avoid confusion.</p><p>If you are working in XSLT 2.0 or 3.0, you gain access to <code>xsl:for-each-group</code> and higher-order functions. These can be faster and clearer than manual grouping with keys. For XSLT 1.0, the Muenchian grouping pattern is still effective, and when combined with keys it remains a strong choice. Either way, focus on minimizing passes over large node sets.</p><p>Also consider the output method. Serializing large outputs can be a significant part of the runtime. If you do not need pretty-printed XML, avoid indentation to reduce the amount of whitespace and processing time. Similarly, if you are generating text or JSON, use <code>method="text"</code> or structured XSLT 3.0 serialization options rather than building a text string node by node.</p><p>I recommend using realistic test data when tuning performance. A transform that runs in 100 milliseconds on a tiny input may take seconds on real data. Use a handful of real documents and measure changes as you apply each improvement. This keeps the optimization process grounded and prevents you from making the code worse without a measurable gain.</p><p>Finally, keep a balance between speed and clarity. The fastest stylesheet is useless if it is too hard to maintain. Use a few consistent patterns: keys for lookups, modes for pipelines, variables for repeated values, and limited selection scope. With those in place, the performance usually becomes acceptable without heroics.</p><p>If you want a quick way to benchmark different approaches with the same input set, try the online editor at <a href=https://xsltplayground.com>https://xsltplayground.com</a>. It is a convenient place to experiment with keys, modes, and alternative match patterns while keeping your transform readable.</p></div><p class="muted back-link"><a href=/posts/>← Back to Posts</a></p></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class="container footer-grid"><p>Built with Hugo · 2026-01-15</p><p class=muted>Repo: <a href=https://github.com/alexandrev/xslt-lab>alexandrev/xslt-lab</a></p></div></footer></body></html>
