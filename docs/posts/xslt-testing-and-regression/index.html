A small change can impact downstream systems, and because the output is just data, regressions can go unnoticed until a business process breaks. You do not need a massive testing framework to prevent this. A lightweight, repeatable testing approach with a few representative inputs can catch most issues and make changes far safer to deploy.</p><p>Start by curating a compact test corpus. Choose a handful of XML inputs that represent the most important scenarios: a normal case, a case with missing optional elements, a case with unexpected or additional fields, and a case with edge values such as empty strings or special characters. Keep these documents small and focused so you can understand the expected output at a glance. Store them alongside the stylesheet to keep the transformation and tests tightly connected.</p><p>Next, define expected outputs. This can be literal expected output files, or it can be key assertions. In XSLT 2.0 and 3.0, you can use <code>xsl:assert</code> to enforce invariants such as required elements or output ordering. In XSLT 1.0, you can still build a test harness by comparing the output to known-good files. The important thing is that the tests are deterministic and easy to run.</p><p>A practical approach is to create a wrapper script that runs the transform against each input and diffs the output against the expected result. If you are using a CI pipeline, this is easy to automate. If you are running locally, you can use a simple shell script or a makefile target. The key is to reduce friction so you actually run the tests before shipping a change.</p><p>Beyond output equality, consider adding structure checks. For example, if your output is XML, use an XML-aware diff or validate the output against a schema. For JSON outputs, parse and validate. For CSV, load into a parser and verify column count. These checks help catch cases where output is syntactically valid but structurally wrong. They also help maintain consistent ordering when you refactor templates.</p><p>One effective pattern is to include a test-only mode in your stylesheet. In this mode, you can output debug traces or additional metadata that is useful for validation. You keep the production output clean while making it easier to assert internal behavior during tests. The mode can be controlled with a parameter, so you do not need a separate stylesheet.</p><p>If your transform depends on external inputs, mock them. For example, if you read reference data from a lookup file, keep a small version of that file in your test fixtures. This makes the tests independent and fast. The smaller and more deterministic the inputs, the easier it is to interpret test failures.</p><p>Finally, document the test scenarios. A short README with a one-line description of each fixture is enough. When new cases come in, add them to the test set and keep the suite small but representative. Over time, this becomes a powerful safety net that speeds up changes rather than slowing them down.</p><p>One more tip: keep track of transformation time for each fixture. Even a simple timestamp around the transform can reveal regressions that functional tests do not catch. If a mapping suddenly takes twice as long, that is a signal to review recent changes or input growth. Performance is part of correctness in integration flows, and small slowdowns can turn into outages when volume spikes.</p><p>If you want to iterate on tests and outputs quickly, the online editor at <a href=https://xsltplayground.com>https://xsltplayground.com</a> is a convenient place to run your fixtures, compare outputs, and refine expectations before you bake them into your automated checks.</p></div><p class="muted back-link"><a href=/posts/>← Back to Posts</a></p></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class="container footer-grid"><p>Built with Hugo · 2026-01-15</p><p class=muted>Repo: <a href=https://github.com/alexandrev/xslt-lab>alexandrev/xslt-lab</a></p></div></footer></body></html>
