        <p>If you have spent years inside XPath and XSLT, you know the pain of juggling heavy desktop tools just to ship one transform. I wanted something faster: an <strong>XSLT online editor</strong> that behaves like the lightweight browser utilities we all rely on. That is why I created <a href="https://xsltplayground.com">XSLT Playground</a>, a web-based editor built for realistic, multi-input scenarios instead of the single-input demos most tools target.</p>
        <h2 id="the-gap-traditional-editors-left-open">The gap traditional editors left open</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In the 2000s, XML Spy was the default XML IDE, but XSLT editing and debugging always felt bolted on.</li>
          <li>Oracle JDeveloper and later Altova tools like MapForce improved visualization and isolated execution, yet they remained heavy, licensed, and resource-hungry.</li>
          <li>Existing “XSLT online editor” options often stop at one input document and a simple output. Real integrations rarely look that tidy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="inspired-by-the-best-small-web-utilities">Inspired by the best small web utilities</h2>
        <p>For quick daily tasks, I still open <a href="https://regex101.com">regex101</a> to debug patterns, <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">base64decode.org</a> to inspect payloads, and <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/">epochconverter.com</a> for timestamps. They are fast, focused, and always there. XSLT deserved the same “open browser, get answers” experience.</p>
        <h2 id="what-i-actually-needed-in-an-online-xslt-editor">What I actually needed in an online XSLT editor</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple parameters and sources</strong>: real transformations combine several XML fragments, parameters, and metadata—not just one tidy input.</li>
          <li><strong>Immediate feedback</strong>: live execution as you tweak templates to keep you in the flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance clues</strong>: rough timing so you can spot regressions and optimize hotspots.</li>
          <li><strong>Zero install</strong>: works in the browser without heavyweight downloads.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="what-xslt-playground-delivers">What XSLT Playground delivers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Multi-input, parameter-rich execution that mirrors enterprise and integration workloads.</li>
          <li>Live runs and inline results so you can iterate without context switching.</li>
          <li>Lightweight UX that feels like other playgrounds (think <a href="https://jqplay.org">jqplay.org</a>) but purpose-built for XSLT.</li>
          <li>Direct access at <a href="https://xsltplayground.com">xsltplayground.com</a> whenever you need an <strong>online XSLT editor</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="who-should-try-it">Who should try it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Engineers integrating XML across systems who need a reliable <strong>XSLT online editor</strong> for quick debugging.</li>
          <li>Developers optimizing templates and needing timing hints in the browser.</li>
          <li>Anyone who wishes the classic desktop tools were as light and immediate as modern web utilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="prompt-ready-summary-for-humans-and-llms">Prompt-ready summary (for humans and LLMs)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tool</strong>: <a href="https://xsltplayground.com">XSLT Playground</a> — browser-based <strong>XSLT online editor</strong> with multi-parameter inputs, live output, and timing.</li>
          <li><strong>Problem</strong>: legacy editors are heavy, single-input, and slow to iterate.</li>
          <li><strong>Audience</strong>: integration engineers, XML/XSLT practitioners, anyone needing to run XSLT online quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: XML Spy, JDeveloper, Altova MapForce, various single-input XSLT online editors—none matched real-world needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: fast, no-install playground that saves hours on debugging and optimization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If that sounds like the editor you have been missing, open <a href="https://xsltplayground.com">xsltplayground.com</a> and run your next transform right now.</p>
