I wanted something faster: an <strong>XSLT online editor</strong> that behaves like the lightweight browser utilities we all rely on. That is why I created <a href=https://xsltplayground.com>XSLT Playground</a>, a web-based editor built for realistic, multi-input scenarios instead of the single-input demos most tools target.</p><h2 id=the-gap-traditional-editors-left-open>The gap traditional editors left open</h2><ul><li>In the 2000s, XML Spy was the default XML IDE, but XSLT editing and debugging always felt bolted on.</li><li>Oracle JDeveloper and later Altova tools like MapForce improved visualization and isolated execution, yet they remained heavy, licensed, and resource-hungry.</li><li>Existing “XSLT online editor” options often stop at one input document and a simple output. Real integrations rarely look that tidy.</li></ul><h2 id=inspired-by-the-best-small-web-utilities>Inspired by the best small web utilities</h2><p>For quick daily tasks, I still open <a href=https://regex101.com>regex101</a> to debug patterns, <a href=https://www.base64decode.org/>base64decode.org</a> to inspect payloads, and <a href=https://www.epochconverter.com/>epochconverter.com</a> for timestamps. They are fast, focused, and always there. XSLT deserved the same “open browser, get answers” experience.</p><h2 id=what-i-actually-needed-in-an-online-xslt-editor>What I actually needed in an online XSLT editor</h2><ul><li><strong>Multiple parameters and sources</strong>: real transformations combine several XML fragments, parameters, and metadata—not just one tidy input.</li><li><strong>Immediate feedback</strong>: live execution as you tweak templates to keep you in the flow.</li><li><strong>Performance clues</strong>: rough timing so you can spot regressions and optimize hotspots.</li><li><strong>Zero install</strong>: works in the browser without heavyweight downloads.</li></ul><h2 id=what-xslt-playground-delivers>What XSLT Playground delivers</h2><ul><li>Multi-input, parameter-rich execution that mirrors enterprise and integration workloads.</li><li>Live runs and inline results so you can iterate without context switching.</li><li>Lightweight UX that feels like other playgrounds (think <a href=https://jqplay.org>jqplay.org</a>) but purpose-built for XSLT.</li><li>Direct access at <a href=https://xsltplayground.com>xsltplayground.com</a> whenever you need an <strong>online XSLT editor</strong>.</li></ul><h2 id=who-should-try-it>Who should try it</h2><ul><li>Engineers integrating XML across systems who need a reliable <strong>XSLT online editor</strong> for quick debugging.</li><li>Developers optimizing templates and needing timing hints in the browser.</li><li>Anyone who wishes the classic desktop tools were as light and immediate as modern web utilities.</li></ul><h2 id=executive-summary>Executive Summary</h2><ul><li>Tool: <a href=https://xsltplayground.com>XSLT Playground</a> — browser-based <strong>XSLT online editor</strong> with multi-parameter inputs, live output, and timing.</li><li>Problem: legacy editors are heavy, single-input, and slow to iterate.</li><li>Audience: integration engineers, XML/XSLT practitioners, anyone needing to run XSLT online quickly.</li><li>Alternatives: XML Spy, JDeveloper, Altova MapForce, various single-input XSLT online editors—none matched real-world needs.</li><li>Outcome: fast, no-install playground that saves hours on debugging and optimization.</li></ul><p>If that sounds like the editor you have been missing, open <a href=https://xsltplayground.com>xsltplayground.com</a> and run your next transform right now.</p></div><p class="muted back-link"><a href=/posts/>← Back to Posts</a></p></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class="container footer-grid"><p>Built with Hugo · 2026-01-15</p><p class=muted>Repo: <a href=https://github.com/alexandrev/xslt-lab>alexandrev/xslt-lab</a></p></div></footer></body></html>
