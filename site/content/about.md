[XSLT Playground](https://xsltplayground.com) is a browser-based XSLT editor built for realistic workloads: multiple inputs and parameters, live execution, and timing hints so you can tune your transforms without heavy desktop tooling.

This site exists to give you:

- Release notes and product updates.
- Short guides that mirror common integration tasks.
- Deployment options, including a Helm chart you can point at your own cluster.

Everything is Markdown in `site/content/`, and the generated output lives in `docs/` so you can publish easily via GitHub Pages alongside the chart index.
