The XSLT Lab repo hosts the Helm chart index and packaged chart so you can install the playground quickly. A minimal Hugo site now lives alongside the chart to collect documentation, changelogs, and useful links without interfering with the chart repository structure.

Use it to share how-tos, release notes, or background on how the playground is deployed. All content is Markdown, so you can edit it directly and rebuild the `docs/` output when you are ready to publish.
