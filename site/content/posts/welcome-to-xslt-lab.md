[XSLT Playground](https://xsltplayground.com) is a browser-first XSLT editor that lets you run transforms with multiple inputs and parameters, see results instantly, and spot performance hotspots without installing anything. This blog gathers the practical pieces you need around it.

What you will find here:

- Product updates and release notes for the playground.
- XSLT debugging recipes tailored to multi-parameter, real-world scenarios.
- Deployment notes, including the Helm chart and self-hosting guidance.

If you want to try it now, head straight to [xsltplayground.com](https://xsltplayground.com). If you want to contribute content, edit the Markdown in `site/content/` and rebuild the site with `hugo --source site --minify` to publish to `docs/`.
