This repo now contains a Hugo site so you can publish notes, guides, and announcements next to the Helm chart.

What you get:

- A landing page that links to the chart index.
- A posts section for updates and long-form guides.
- A configurable menu and simple styling that lives entirely in this repo.

Run `hugo --source site --minify` to generate the static site into `docs/`, commit the output, and point GitHub Pages at the `docs` folder to go live.
