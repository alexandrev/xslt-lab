Many real-world transformations do not run on a single XML document. You often merge a primary payload with reference data, catalog lookups, or environment configuration. Done well, this results in a clean, predictable transform. Done poorly, it becomes a maze of `document()` calls and hidden dependencies. The difference is in how you model inputs and parameters from the start. As an integration engineer, I treat input selection and parameter design as first-class API design for the stylesheet.

Start by naming every input. Instead of embedding `document('config.xml')` in multiple templates, load each external document once near the top of the stylesheet and bind it to a global variable. This makes dependencies explicit and keeps the rest of the code focused on mapping. It also helps with testing, because you can override the URI with a parameter. A clean pattern is to define `xsl:param` values for input URIs and then bind them to `xsl:variable` values that hold the parsed documents.

The same clarity applies to parameters. Keep parameters primitive and predictable, and avoid passing in node sets unless you truly need them. A parameter should be an external knob: region, language, a feature flag, or an output format. If you have a complex decision tree, consider using a lookup XML or JSON input and then query it inside the stylesheet. This approach keeps the invocation interface stable while still letting you evolve business rules.

A simple skeleton might look like this:

```xml
<xsl:param name="catalog-uri"/>
<xsl:param name="region" select="'us'"/>

<xsl:variable name="catalog" select="document($catalog-uri)"/>
```

From there, templates can reference `$catalog` without worrying about IO or base URIs. You can also define a named template that accepts a parameter for reuse across multiple modes. This is useful when the same output block is needed for several sections of the document but the selection context differs.

When combining multiple inputs, always anchor your lookups to a clear key. If you can, define `xsl:key` on the external document so lookups are efficient and readable. In XSLT 2.0 or 3.0, `xsl:for-each-group` and the `map` types can reduce boilerplate, but the core idea remains: make your joins explicit and deterministic. If you rely on default order or on undocumented assumptions about uniqueness, you will eventually get a hard-to-reproduce bug.

Another important integration pattern is separating parsing from formatting. For example, you might normalize all values from the various inputs into a canonical intermediate structure and then render that structure into the final output. This makes testing easier and supports future outputs such as CSV, JSON, or a secondary XML format. Even in XSLT 1.0, you can emulate this by creating result tree fragments, then processing them in a second pass if needed.

Multiple inputs also raise questions about fallbacks. Decide how you want to behave when optional data is missing. I prefer to centralize defaults in a few named templates or functions and avoid sprinkling `xsl:choose` blocks everywhere. This keeps the stylesheet readable and makes it obvious how to override the defaults later. Document your fallbacks in the code with short, clear names so a future maintainer does not have to rediscover the rules by reading the entire stylesheet.

Finally, create a small set of inputs that represent common scenarios and run them regularly. For example, have a baseline case, a case with missing reference data, and a case with unexpected elements. These are the cases that reveal poor assumptions about inputs. A fast way to iterate on these scenarios is to run the transform with a tool that lets you swap inputs and parameters quickly.

If you want to try these patterns with real inputs and multiple documents, the online editor at [https://xsltplayground.com](https://xsltplayground.com) is built for that workflow. It lets you load multiple XML documents and parameters, see how they interact, and keep your integration logic transparent as it grows.
