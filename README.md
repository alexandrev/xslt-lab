# xslt-lab

Your Lab for XSLT Transformation.

## Frontend

The React/Vite frontend lives in `frontend/`. Use `npm install` inside that folder and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the playground at `http://localhost:3000`.

The app will call the Go backend at `/transform` to perform XSLT transformations.
